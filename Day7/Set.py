# Explain the difference between the following data types: string, list, tuple and set
# strings are character types enclosed by quotation marks. They are iterable, ordered and unmutable.
# list is a collection of similar of different data types. They are iterable ,ordered and mutable
# tuples are like lists but are unmutable
# sets contain unique elements in the collection. They are unordered but mutable.
